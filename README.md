I am a life-long technophile with interests in computer security, functional programming, systems design, and general hackery. I have spent the last two years working at Security Innovation as a Security Engineer.

My specialties are embedded devices, binary exploitation, and producing educational content for security professionals.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a type-safe [board game server](https://github.com/Maxfield-Chen/liberty-go-server) in Haskell using the Servant and Reflex libraries!

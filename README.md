I am a life-long technophile with interests in computer security, functional programming, systems design, and general hackery. I spent five odd years working at Security Innovation doing all manner of penetration testing and bit banging.

Last year I joined Cedar as a Sr. Application Security Engineer!

My specialties are building security teams from the ground up. I love threat modeling, secure architecture design, embedded devices, and producing educational content for security professionals.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a type-safe [board game server](https://github.com/Maxfield-Chen/liberty-go-server) in Haskell using the Servant and Reflex libraries!
